ASIS2XML
========

ASIS is the Ada Semantic Interface Specification; see
<http://www.acm.org/sigada/WG/asiswg/>.

This program converts a unit's ASIS representation into XML, so as to
make it easier to develop transformational tools using (for example)
XSLT.

Prerequisites
-------------

GNAT 3.15p or later
The corresponding GNAT ASIS
XML/Ada 1.0 or later

Building
--------

These instructions are written for Linux and assume you've already
extracted the distribution into your home directory; the files are at
~/asis2xml-yyyymmdd/. The supplied Makefile uses the GNAT Project file
build.gpr, which makes assumptions about where things are; they should
be straightforward to change.

Install ASIS-for-GNAT. I've used "make INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/asis-3.15p"
(substitute your GNAT version there).

Make a symbolic link ~/asis pointing to the directory where the ASIS
installation has placed the source code (with 3.15p it's in
INSTALL_DIR/asis).

Unpack XML/Ada.

Make a symbolic link ~/xmlada pointing to the XML/Ada installation
directory.

Go to the asis2xml directory and just say "make".

Installation
------------

Copy asis2xml to a directory on your path.

Use
---

asis2xml will accept either a spec file (.ads) or a tree file
(.adt). The GNAT ASIS implementation doesn't understand Project files,
so if you have any sort of complex path setup the way to go is to
generate the tree file:

  $ gnatmake -Pbuild -c -u -f -gnatct example.ads

creates example.adt in your project (build.gpr)'s Object_Dir -- in the
case of asis2xml's build.gpr, this is ./.build. You have to have the
input file in the current directory, because asis2xml assumes the
parameter filename specifies the unit. This will be sorted!

  $ asis2xml example.adt >example.xml

The output is in "packed" XML; to get a more legible view, you can
use HTML Tidy from http://tidy.sourceforge.net/:

   $ asis2xml example.adt | tidy -xml -i >example.xml

or variations.
