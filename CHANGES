ASIS2XML
========

ASIS is the Ada Semantic Interface Specification; see
<http://www.acm.org/sigada/WG/asiswg/>.

This program converts a unit's ASIS representation into XML, so as to
make it easier to develop transformational tools using (for example)
XSLT.

    o Compatible with GNAT GPL 2010.

    o Doesn't report these Ada2005 elements:
      An_Interface_Type_Definition
      A_Formal_Interface_Type_Definition
      An_Access_Definition
      An_Expression_Path

    o Reworked the -s support (component sizes for streaming). NB,
      this corresponds to the Ada2005 attribute S'Stream_Size.

    o Removal of an extra '&#10;' after the initial XML processing
      instruction.

    o Revision of the INSTALL note, Makefile and GPR to be a better
      match for the current AdaCore Libre package installation scheme
      (install under ~/local, ADA_PROJECT_PATH set to
      ~/local/lib/gnat).
