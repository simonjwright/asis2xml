<h1>ASIS2XML</h1>

<p>ASIS is the Ada Semantic Interface Specification; see
<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigada/WG/asiswg/">http://www.acm.org/sigada/WG/asiswg/</a>.

<p>This program converts a unit's ASIS representation into XML, so as
to make it easier to develop transformational tools using (for
example) XSLT.

<p>As supplied, it relies on GNAT; the only GNAT feature it relies on
is that Data_Decomposition.Size has been extended to work for Subtype
Indications; and that only so that it can work out how many bytes a
record component will occupy when streamed.

<p>Not every ASIS feature is supported yet.

<p>There is no XML Schema as yet. The output's structure is quite
close to that of ASIS, at least in overall terms; for example,
an <tt>A_Defining_Name</tt> element in ASIS is represented as a
&lt;defining_name/&gt; element in XML.
